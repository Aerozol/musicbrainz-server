=head2 cancel_or_action

Given an edit, maybe a redirect URI, and an action to take, if the edit can be
cancelled by the current user, do that; if not, take the action.

This function is used to implement delete page behavior of "if the current
editor added this thing and the edit's still open, cancel it instead of
entering a delete edit."
